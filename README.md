I have recreate those web pages.

Section1:

I have added clean, colorful icons to make it easy for users to quickly understand and access what they need.

Section2: 

I added background colors to the graphs to help users more easily understand and distinguish the key information in each section. Previously, it felt unclear and hard to interpret.

Section3: 

In the previous card section design, there were too many icons, which created visual clutter and negatively impacted the user experience. If more information were to be added, the design would appear even more crowded. To improve clarity and avoid confusion, the current design replaces excessive icons with clean bullet points, making the content easier for users to understand.


Tool: 

I have used Figma tool here.
